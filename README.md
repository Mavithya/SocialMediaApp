🌐 **Socialite – A Full-Stack Social Media Web Application**

Socialite is a lightweight, full-stack social media platform that we designed and developed as a collaborative team project.
Our goal was to create a modern, secure, and scalable web application where users can connect, share, and interact seamlessly.

✨ **Key Features**

-  **Secure Authentication**: Complete user registration and login system using Spring Security session management and BCrypt password hashing.  
-  **Post Management and Dynamic Feed**: Create posts with text content, media attachments (images/videos), and location tagging. The home feed aggregates posts from the user and their friends, sorted chronologically.  
-  **Interactive Content**: Like, comment on, and share posts using custom share text, with all interactions updated seamlessly using AJAX.  
-  **Friend Management**: Send, accept, or decline friend requests with real-time friend suggestions.  
-  **Quick Search**: Instantly search for other users and posts within the platform.  
-  **User Profiles**: View and edit user profiles, including personal details and profile picture uploads.  


🛠 **Technologies & Tools Used**

-  **Backend**: Spring Boot (Web, Security, Data JPA)  
-  **Frontend**: Thymeleaf, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript  
-  **Database**: PostgreSQL  
-  **Other Tools**: Maven, Git & GitHub, Flyway  


🏗️ **Architecture**

The application follows a classic **MVC (Model–View–Controller)** architecture, ensuring:  

-  **Clean separation of concerns**  
-  **Better maintainability**  
-  **Scalability for future enhancements**
